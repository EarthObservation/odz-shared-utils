# IAPÅ  ODZ Shared Utilities Repository

This repository contains a collection of useful scripts, functions, and Jupyter notebooks developed by our department. It is intended for internal use, collaboration, and sharing of common tools.

---

## Structure
- `cheat_sheets/`: Any documents with tips and tricks for coding, workflows and more.
- `scripts/`: Standalone scripts for various processing tasks.
- `notebooks/`: Example notebooks showcasing workflows or analyses.
- `functions/`: Reusable modules grouped by domain (e.g. lidar, geospatial).
- `tests/`: Unit tests for core functions.

## Contributing
Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on how to contribute.

## Python File Docstring Format
Each Python file should begin with a module-level docstring that includes:
- **Date of creation**
- **Author**
- **Short description** of what the script or module does

### Example:
```python

```

## Jupyter Notebook Header Format
At the beginning of each Jupyter notebook, include a Markdown cell with the following metadata:
- **Title**
- **Date of creation**
- **Author**
- **Short description** of what the notebook demonstrates or analyses

### Example:
```markdown
